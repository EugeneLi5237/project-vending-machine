# Project Vending Machine

A vending machine powered by open source contributions! :atm:

## Goal

By the end of the year (June 2019), we want to build a small vending machine where you pay for items with open source contributions to the @eceusc github account.

The endgame transaction would be:

1. Person gets a pull request merged in from any repo in the @eceusc GitHub org.
2. Person logins to some sort of webapp and "orders" an item from the vending machine
3. User is given a code where, once inputted into the vending machine, they get the item! :tada:


Of course, there would be many prototypes made until we get the ideal workflow above, but it'll take some time!

## Structure

This repo is empty as of now (bc the project hasn't started yet), but this repo will be divided into several parts. For example, there will be directories called `/arduino`, `/rasberry-pi`, `/web-app`, etc. Each directory will have their own contribution guides.
